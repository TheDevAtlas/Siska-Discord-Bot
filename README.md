This project has the goal of giving a server a unique fact of the day, news article, joke, etc at a certain time. It also includes basic commands for users like returning the date and time, rolling a dice, and other functions. While this specific bot is not meant to do complex calls and responses, it can return useful functions depending on the server's users.

If you wish to take on a similar project here is some suggested reading (or watching).
